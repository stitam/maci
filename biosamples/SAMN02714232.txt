Description:
In this project, multidrug resistant isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii were obtained from the main public hospital, Hospital Sultanah Nur Zahirah, in Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia, for characterization. Strain AC29 was isolated in 2011 and is resistant to the carbapenems, meropenem and imipenem, and also resistant to ceftoxitin, gentamycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, oxacillin, penicillin, rifampin, vancomycin, tobramycin, trimethamycin, amikacin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, neomycin, streptomycin, mupirocin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, teicoplanin, iinezolid, and norfloxacin. However, this strain was susceptible to polymyxin B.
