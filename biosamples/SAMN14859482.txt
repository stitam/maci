Description:
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used to investigate an outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CR-Ab) within an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Burns facility at a Brisbane hospital between 2016-2018. All isolates were initially sequenced with Illumina paired-end sequencing. A single A. baumannii (MS14413) isolate and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MS14393) isolate were sequenced to completion on the Pacific Biosciences RSII platform.
